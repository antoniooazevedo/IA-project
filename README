<div style="text-align: justify">

## Introduction
Sokobond is a game created by Alan Hazelden and Lee Shang Lun and "is an elegantly designed puzzle game about chemistry". The game is available on Steam and has been well received by players and critics alike. The game is a puzzle game where the player must move atoms to create molecules. The game is designed to teach players about chemistry and the mechanics of the game are based on real-world chemistry principles.

## Rules
In Sokobond, you control atoms on a grid with a clear objective: navigate them around and bond them with other atoms to create molecules. You have two main actions: moving in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), or pushing nearby atoms in those same directions.

To form a molecule, simply move your atom/molecule to a spot adjacent to another atom with available bonding connections. Both atoms will then lose one bonding connection and combine. The game is completed when all atoms are merged into one molecule and all bonding connections are utilized.
